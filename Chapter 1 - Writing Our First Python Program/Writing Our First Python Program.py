# first program to add two numbers
 
a = 10 # store 10 into variable a - line 1
b = 25 # store 25 into variable b - line 2 
c = a + b # add 10 and 25 and store into variable c - line 3  
print("Sum= ", c) # display the sum - line 4 

# README 
# The hash '#' symbol represents the comments line in Python. 
# memory location are called 'variable'. In the second line of our program, we stored
# the data into a variable (or memory location) by the name 'a' as:
# a = 10

# similarly, in the 2 line, we stored data 25 into another variable 'b' as:
# b = 25 

# In the 3 line, we added another by writing 'a + b' The result pf this sum should be 
# stored into another variable (or memory location) by the name 'c' as:
# c = a + b 

# the result is in 'c' We should now display the result on the screen for the user.
# This is done by print() function. The purpose of a function is to perfrom a Task
# print(c)
# this will display the result 35. But we went to display some message.
# sum = 35

# this will help the user to understand the result clearly. For this purpose, we used 
# the print() function in 4 line as:
# print("Sum = ", c)

# here, "Sum= " is call a string. A string contains a group of character and is usually 
# enclosed in double quotes or single quotes. String are displayed without any change
# as they are after this string, we put a comma and then 'c' this will display the result as:
# sum = 35
